# Boilermaker
Boilerplate code for creating new plugins and such.

jQuery plugins follow our modified version of the WordPress JS standards. We lint these files with [JSCS](http://jscs.info/). (See `.jscsrc` in this repo.) JavaScript code should also pass a basic [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) check.

PHP code follows the "WordPress Extra" standards and is linted with [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). (See [the code standards themselves](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) and [the documentation for the standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/) for more fun reading).
